I'm back to blogging here. I would like to make it a habit to create a mini blog posts every morning and just work on this blog for 10 minutes. This is more of a personal blog and I don't intend to make a business out of it, it's really only for my own purposes but if you're reading this then thank you. 

I've recently started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5TxD9smqJn-hrhvsrfTecQ) where I talk about how to get a job as a Frontend Developer. I'm going to use this blog to rift on ideas for the channel and to outline scripts. I'll also still be blogging about goal achievement frameworks and life as well.

Today I'm going to be posting a video on whether or not you need a degree to get a job in development. 

I don't think that you do, but it really depends on what your end goal is and how hard you're willing to work.

If you're trying to get a job at a fortune 500 company that has a HR department, it's going to be difficult to get a job there without a degree, but it's possible.

If you have a big body of work and it's obvious that you know what you're doing, you could probably get a job there. Having a portfolio of work, a blog, and a YouTube channel will help you get in the door, and then if you really knock it out of the park in the interview then there's no reason you won't get the job. 

If you want to get a job at a startup or build your own company, then no degree is required.
