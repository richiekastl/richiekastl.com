> "Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself." - Marcus Aurelius.

I'm back to posting again and I am doing a challenge to do a blog post every single day this week. This is day 1 and my first blog post in 2 months. I'm hoping that this challenge will get me back into the habit of blogging again.

I try to follow what Marcus Aurelius said and sometimes it brings me down if I'm being honest. I set really high goals and I don't always achieve them, I usually fall short. 

Sometimes it isn't a bad thing though. 

I have a really high goal of becoming a millionaire. When I was in my early 20's I set that goal for myself to do it by the time I was 25. I'm currently 28 and I am still very far from my goal but I've taken steps towards it. 

If it wasn't for my goal I wouldn't have started this blog.

I wouldn't won't so hard at my job.

I wouldn't have bought this duplex that I'm currently living in and renting out the other side.

I'm still on the right path, it's just going to take me longer to get there.

I may have fallen short of my goals last quarter, but at least I put out 5 blog posts. Those were 5 more blog posts than what I did have. 

Deciding on my niche also has led to me learning a lot more about Advanced Custom Fields and led me to experiment more with them. 

I feel like I've created the best websites I've ever created because of just choosing my niche. I haven't even made a single blog post about Advanced Custom Fields yet, but because I now see myself as a blogger who writes about Advanced Custom Fields, it leads me to learn more about it. 

I'm going to start being more consistent with my blog posts and I'm going to complete this challenge this week. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you have learned something.
