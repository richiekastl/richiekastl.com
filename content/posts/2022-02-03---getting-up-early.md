I believe that getting up early is the best thing you could do for yourself. Every morning that I get up at 4 or 5am, I have a super productive day. Days that I sleep in, the opposite happens. Finding the balance between having enough sleep and getting up early is difficult. 

The idea of getting up really early in the morning came to me from Jocko Willink who gets up every day at 4:30am but has admitted that he doesn't get enough sleep. After reading Matthew Walker's book called Why We Sleep, I've been making sure I get my 8 hours every night. Sleeo is super important, it affects every system in your body. 

Finding the balance between getting up early and still getting the sleep I need is very hard.
