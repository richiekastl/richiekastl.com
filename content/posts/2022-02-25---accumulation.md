Every year I decide on a word that will be my north star for the year. 

Back in 2018, it was fearless and I took a 6 week vacation from my job to go backpacking trip across Europe. 

In 2019, it was growth and I bought my first duplex that year. 

In 2020, it was resist and I used that to counter bad habits.

In 2021 that word was consistency and I established routines.

This year, 2022, that word is accumulation. I'm going to accumulate views and subscribers on YouTube, I'm going to accumulate more blog posts, I'm going to accumulate more fans and more work for my contracting business. 

Whats your word for this year?
