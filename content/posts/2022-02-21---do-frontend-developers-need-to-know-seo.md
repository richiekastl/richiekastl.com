This week, I'm going to post a video on whether or not Frontend Web Developers should know SEO. 

I think that it really depends on what you're going after.

If you want to work at an agency, then by all means learn SEO at the deepest levels that you can.

At an agency, being a swiss army knife is better than being great at one thing. 

That was the case at the agencies I worked at anyway. 

Knowing SEO will help you develop your websites with the end in mind. 

A website doesn't just sit there and generate profit for you, you need to constantly add fuel to it in the form of website updates such as blog posts. 

Being able to execute technical SEO on a website out of the box will be invaluable for the clients. 

If you know both SEO and Frontend Development, you will stand out from the crowd when applying for a job at an agency.

Resources to learn SEO would be, [Digital Marketer's SEO Certification course](https://www.digitalmarketer.com/lp/search-marketing-mastery/)(paid), [learningseo.io](https://learningseo.io/)(free), and [Moz's SEO Learning Center](https://moz.com/learn/seo)(free).

If you want to end up at a company such as Facebook or Twitter, then there really isn't a need to learn SEO, there you will need to know Frontend Web Development quickly.
