If there's one thing in life I don't like it's flakey people. People who say that they're going to do something and then skip out at the last minute. 

I know I sound like a hypocrite right now but I'm not going to let myself fail the challenge of writing one blog post everyday this week. 

I show you the real side of me on this blog and sometimes it's ugly. I just hope you learn and grow from my mistakes. 

I am very tired right now and I would like to sleep but I'm writing this blog post for you guy instead. 

Sticking to your commitments should be treated as a matter of life and death.

If I had stuck to my commitments I made to myself I would have my dream body, I would have made much more money, I would have a game or two developed but I didn't take my commitments seriously. If I had stuck to the commitments I made on this very blog I would have made a lot of traction with it already and I would have many high quality posts.

I committed to running pretty much every day to train for the Akron marathon but I've skipped a lot of days this year. This could lead to me getting injured during the marathon, which could lead to me getting bedridden, which could lead me to dying within the next 4-5 years of heart disease because it hurts to exercise and I just give up on it.

It's an extreme example but it's not outside of the realm of possibility.

That example can be applied to any goal or commitment you set. 

It's deadly to not achieve your goals.
