> I just you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent-- no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you" - Seneca

This is a time in history that we will be telling our grandchildren about. It is a time that we get to test ourselves and we get to grow. I know there are a lot of negative things happening because of this pandemic but you can make a lot of positive things happen for yourself during this time. 

I live in Ohio and today is our first day of a state-wide lockdown. My company has been working fully remote for about 2 weeks now. I've worked from home before but only on a one to two day per week basis. 

These are some of the things I do to ensure I have a productive day.

## I make sure I get 8-9 hours of sleep

Sleep is always important but even more so now because <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/expert-answers/lack-of-sleep/faq-20057757" target="_blank">your immune system is weaker without sleep</a>. After reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep I take sleep very seriously. In that book he dives into studies as to why sleep isn't just good for your mental health, it's good for every function in your body.

## I take Athletic Greens 

One of my goals this quarter was to start taking a supplement because I wasn't taking anything before. After a lot of research I decided on Athletic Greens which I'll make a more in-depth blog post on a later date about. This supplement also boosts the immune system because it packs Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Zinc, and Selinum into a one scoop serving. I also take their Vitamin D + Vitamin K supplement to further boost my immune system. 

## I brush my teeth like a champion

I know I sound like your childhood dentist right now but there's an important reason I included this that has nothing to do with your dental health. How you do one thing is how you do everything is a very popular saying that I've found to be true, so I put a lot of work into brushing my teeth. I have a little sand timer that I use to make sure I brush for at least 2 minutes, then I floss my teeth with a flossing stick, then I use mouth wash to clean all of the parts that I missed. I feel great after I put that much work into something as simple as brushing my teeth and then I want to continue that streak into everything else that I do that day...and it's great for my dental health.

## I check my calendar

After reading Deep Work by Cal Newport, I schedule everything on my Google Calendar and I live and die by it. I don't schedule minute things on there like brushing my teeth, instead I time block everything so something like brushing my teeth would fall into my morning routine time block. 

## I check my Trello Board

I've been using Trello for the past 5 years now and I don't really know how to function without it at this point. I'll write a blog post in the future that goes more in-depth into this but 

## I work on personal goals before working

The first thing I do in the morning is that I work on my personal goals (such as writing for this blog) before I start working. I can trade the time I used to use to commute for time to get me closer to my goals. I find that I'm most productive first thing in the morning which is perfect for an activity like writing.
