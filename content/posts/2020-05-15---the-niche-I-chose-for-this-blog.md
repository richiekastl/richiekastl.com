Since I started this blog I have been writing mostly just about what's on my mind and ways I could improve myself and my productivity but I wasn't writing with a certain niche in mind, which is not great for SEO and marketing my blog. I'll still write what's on my mind because this is richiekastl.com and my website, but I'm going to start mostly writing about a little Wordpress plugin known as Advanced Custom Fields or ACF for short.

There were a few other niches that I looked into and I chose ACF because I have a lot of experience with it and it's one of the things that I'm interested in learning more about. Choosing ACF as my niche has quite a few benefits outside of building a profitable side hustle. By learning more about what ACF can do and advanced techniques, I'll be able to develop faster using it and I'll be able to create better websites. There are also other things that I'm interested in using ACF for such as building static Wordpress sites and I'd like to learn more about how to use ACF with Gutenberg. 

I've been following John Sonmez's how to build a blog course while creating this website and one of the exercises were to come up with 50 different blog post ideas for the niche that you decide upon. I did that last night and there are quite a few exciting blog posts that I can't wait to start writing. These are a few of my favorites.

- Why you should use ACF
- ACF vs Gutenberg
- Using ACF IN Gutenberg
- Using ACF to build a React front-end for your Wordpress site

Once I have quite a few posts about ACF under my belt on this blog, I'm going to create a giant post that's an all in one resource about getting started with ACF, why you should use ACF, ACF best practices, and so on. 

I've been wondering aimlessly with this blog for about 2 months now and I'm excited that I finally honed in on a niche that I'm interested in.
