This is going to be a very short post. I just worked for 14 hours and I'm tired. I skipped my run today so I could work. It's not a great feeling but I am happy with the work I put out today. I still have more work to do for the rest of the week but it shouldn't be as bad as it was today. 

I'm digging towards gold with a broken spoon. I'll get there eventually, it'll just take time. The money I make from this job goes straight into paying off my debts and into real estate, one day it'll pay off and I can retire early. It's a hard, long grind, but as long as I keep digging and, making progress everyday, I'll get there. I'll go deeper into my plans in a future blog post.
