This is the easiest time in history to be successful. 

With the intersection of AI, social media, and being able to learn anything you want on YouTube, it's never been easier to start your own business. 

We also have never had this many distractions at any point in history. 

All you have to do to be successful in today's world is learn how to not get distracted by your phone and leverage social media instead of it leveraging you. 

Most of your competition isn't doing this, they're glued to their addictions and would rather be cattle than farmers. 

You'll be the weird one in your social circle, but they'll get over it.
