description: Moving client site from Jekyll to Astro
---

I thought static sites were fast.

Then I started working on moving a client's site from Jekyll to Astro.

And it isn't just faster. It is different.

Like swapping a bicycle for a rocket. Like watching a magician cut out the waiting, the lag, the friction, until it felt like magic.

Pages don't just load. They appear.

And with view transitions, it feels less like a website and more like an app. Less like clicking and more like moving.

Speed changes how people behave. When things happen instantly, hesitation disappears. Actions feel effortless.

And effortless is where conversions happen.

Last year, I took this client's online revenue from $200K to over $1M.

This might push them even higher.

Because the internet rewards speed.

And in business, speed isn't just a feature. It's a weapon.
