What goes into the perfect website?

The perfect website is different for every business, but each website needs to share these core 3 technical rules. 

1. It must be fast
2. It must be easy to update
3. It must be easy to find

Having a WordPress site that is unoptimized only gives you 2 out of the 3 rules. 

Squarespace and Wix only give you 2 out of the 3 rules. 

Shopify only gives you 2 out of the 3 rules. 

The stack I recommend to hit all 3 rules is Astro + Contentful or WordPress API.
