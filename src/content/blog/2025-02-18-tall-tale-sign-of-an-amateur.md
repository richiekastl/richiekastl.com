> The biggest clue that someone is an amateur? They have a million plans, and they all start tomorrow.
> - Steven Pressfield

Amateurs collect big ideas like they’re trophies on a shelf.

Yet day by day, that shelf never empties.

Pros pick one plan and do it now, even when it’s messy.

They start at zero and build something real.

Tomorrow is safe, but safe rarely moves the needle.

Jump in, ready or not, and watch how quickly you stop being an amateur.
