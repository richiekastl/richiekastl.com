Focus. 

I was on a mastermind call yesterday talking about how I'm in limbo right now. 

I don't want any new projects to start because my son can be born any day now and I have no idea what life is going to be like with him.

I was thinking about starting a newsletter, tweeting more, posting on YouTube etc. 

My mastermind said don't do any of that, and instead focus on one channel, which for me is cold email and cold calling. 

I would really like to have a thriving personal brand, but the business growth for me right now is in cold email and cold calling. 

This reminds me of the graph from the Book Essentialism.

If I have my attention divided across several things such as a newsletter, keeping up on Twitter, and posting on YouTube, then my cold outreach efforts will suffer.

If I just focus on cold outreach, I'll be able to make it work.

I hate annoying people with cold outreach, but it can help me help people. 

If I cold call a business, build them an amazing site that converts great, then I have helped them. 

They can now buy braces for their kids, buy their dream car, or simply stay in business. 

For the 100 people I annoyed by cold outreach, the 1 I help will make it worth it.
