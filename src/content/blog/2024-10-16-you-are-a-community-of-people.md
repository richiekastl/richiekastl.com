You are not just yourself, you are a whole community of people. 

You are your past self, your present self, and your future self.

Also your future future self, yourfuture future future self, your past past self, etc.. 

Imagine yourself as a community of people all in one place. 

All of the actions you take in a day affect the whole community.
