description: Should you protect your ego or focus on lucrative opportunities?
---

I have a situation where I could expend energy and stress to chase down a small amount of money and protect my ego, but I also have opportunities to make more than that amount of money.

Chasing down the small amount of money might involve court, and other things and it just isn't worth it compared to how much I could make doing other things.

It sucks, I feel like I'm getting taken advantage of, but time is the most precious thing that we have.

We can always make more money, but we can't make more time.

Concentrate on the things that could change your life if they work out, not on the things that drain your energy but protect your ego.

Let your ego die.
