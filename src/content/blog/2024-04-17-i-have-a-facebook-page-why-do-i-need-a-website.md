"I have a Facebook page, why do I need a website?"

I've heard that above quote quite a few times throughout my career. 

A website is your business's home on the internet. 

It is something that you own that is really hard to take away from you (unless you're on Squarespace, Wix, or a similar service). 

Facebook can shut down your page and then all the work you put into it will vanish.

Your website can help your customers find you on Google and locally. 

Your website can set you apart from your competitors. 

It can answer your customer's questions and they can buy your services or products through it.
