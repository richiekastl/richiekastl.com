Yesterday I talked about the mass video transcriber I created. 

I created it so that I could query AI on any sort of course I go through. 

I download all the videos, transcribe them, put them all in one txt file, then I can talk to Claude Opus about it. 

Claude can give me checklists, answer any of my questions, tell me what to do in specific scenarios, and it's like the course creator is personally coaching me.
