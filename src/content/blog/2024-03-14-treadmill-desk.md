I have a treadmill desk and it makes it so easy to hit 10k steps a day. 

My setup is that I have 3 monitors for my "sitdown" desk, and whenever I want to switch over to the treadmill, I just hit a couple of buttons and then my display from my computer shoots over to 2 monitors on a standing desk that has a treadmill under it. 

I highly suggest a setup like this if you are a desk worker. 

It could save your life.
