Boring things suck. 

Doing taxes. 

Writing blog posts. 

Researching. 

Programming.

Learning.

Your next task.

It's really hard to do all of those things, especially when you're working at home by yourself. 

Nobody wants to do the things I listed, they would rather chase trance-inducing dopamine buttons. 

Being able to be bored is a superpower these days. 

Almost nothing in the digital economy gives you an instant dopamine response. 

Work feels unrewarding on a short time horizon. 

But the boring things is where the gold is buried. 

Do the boring things. 

Normalize being bored.

Only then you will win.
