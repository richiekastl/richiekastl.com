People pay for things they don't need.

They do it because they think it's complicated.

Because they think they have to.

Because someone told them it's the only way.

But most of the time, they're just paying to avoid thinking.

I was paying $100 a month to keep tabs on my client's Google rankings.

A script does it for free.

It runs every day. No subscriptions. No bloat. Just results.

So what was I really paying for?

Convenience? Maybe.

Laziness? Definitely.

This happens everywhere.

People pay for gym memberships instead of doing push-ups.

They buy planners instead of making a list.

They subscribe to tools instead of solving the problem once.

Sometimes, the easiest way to save money is to stop renting your own brain.
