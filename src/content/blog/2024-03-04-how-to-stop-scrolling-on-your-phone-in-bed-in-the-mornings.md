description: Stop just laying in bed doom scrolling

I have a problem of staying in bed for too long, mindlessly scrolling on my phone. 

In James Clear's Atomic Habits, he says in order to break a bad habit, you need to put as much friction between you and the bad habit as possible.

Meaning just make your habit really hard to do. 

There's a device called a kitchen safe. 

It's a safe with a timer originally made to help smokers quit smoking and to lock up your sweets. 

I put my phone in it before I go to bed, and set it to unlock 12 hours later. 

Now I wake up and I have nothing to do except go to my computer. 

Problem solved, for now.
