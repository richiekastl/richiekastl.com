One tool that I recommend for getting more done in less time is called Focus Blocks. 

You can sign up for it here: https://2000books.com/focusblocks/

It's a continous call that you can join at the top of every hour. 

There are usually 20-30 people on the call and they're all productivity nerds like you and me. 

When you join, you declare what your intention is for the hour, then everyone goes and works as hard as they can for 50 minutes. 

It's a great productivity tool that also makes you feel less lonely.
