I'm currently listening to [Cal Newport on the Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atuEOcRznpA&t) and one takeaway I got was how to plan out your big goals. We also use this framework in a group I'm in called Quantum Leap.

You define what your big goals are for the year. Then you break that goal down into smaller goals for each quarter, then you take those goals and break them down for each month, then you take those and break them down for each week, then you take those and break them down for each day.

This way you could plan out every single day to reach your big goals.
