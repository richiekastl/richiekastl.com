I've been following Astro for a while now. 

Why would you pick Astro over other web frameworks? 

Well let me take a step back. 

Most of my client's websites are on WordPress. 

WordPress makes it really easy for clients to update their websites and add more content. 

The issue is that, in order to make it fast, you have to rely on services like Nitropack or WP Rocket. 

You can thank WordPress's plugin architecture for that. 

The plugins load many external resources, you have little control over it. 

That's why services like Nitropack exist. 

Not only do the plugins make your site slower, but you have to keep them updated or else it's a security vulnerability. 

What I like about Astro is that it is fast by default and it compiles down to a static html, so it's great for SEO. 

Astro also has built-in page transitions, making it easy to make your website seamlessly load pages. 

Then with Astro, you could use a service like Contentful to make it easy for the client to update their website.

Astro is worth checking out.
