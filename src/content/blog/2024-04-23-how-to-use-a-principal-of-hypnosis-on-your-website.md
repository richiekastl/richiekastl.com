I've been going through the Mike Mandel Hypnosis Academy and I would like to teach you something about hypnosis that could help you get more sales on your website. 

In hypnosis there is a principal called "heteroaction". 

It means that if you can get someone to do something small, then they're more likely to do something else, even if it's unrelated. 

Hypnotists use this by asking you to focus on something, lift a finger, etc. 

You could use this on your website by asking your customer to do something small. 

Whether it be to give something a like, sign up for your email list, leave a comment, etc. 

If you can get your customer to do something small, then they're more likely to purchase from you.
