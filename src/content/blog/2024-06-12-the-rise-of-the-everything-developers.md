Back in the day (before AI and even now), developers silo'd themselves off from each other. 

We have the Java developers vs the JavaScript developers. 

The Ruby on Rails people and the Swift people. 

The C#'ers and the C's. 

You get the point. 

With AI, the Java developers can dabble into the JavaScript world and vice versa. 

Sure a Java developer wouldn't code up a JavaScript project as fast or as well as a full-fledged JavaScript developer, but they can do it. 

The most recent project I've been working on is really heavy on Python, and I'm not really a Python developer, but I'm getting it done much faster than I would have before AI.  

AI enables us to switch between languages, programming things that would have taken us years before.
