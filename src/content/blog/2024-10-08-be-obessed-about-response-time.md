Most people follow what Tim Ferriss taught in his book the 4-Hour Workweek.

In it, he recommends only checking email in short, intense bursts.

And now that is what is common among computer workers, and it is common to expect lagging response times.

If you have clients or a boss, reconsider this notion and be obsessed about responding quickly. 

Blow their minds with how fast you respond to their requests.

This will set you apart from everyone else. 

In the world of sales, the people who actually close the most deals are the ones who respond to leads the quickest.

We are always selling ourselves in every situation.

If you want to be a top performer, respond quickly.
