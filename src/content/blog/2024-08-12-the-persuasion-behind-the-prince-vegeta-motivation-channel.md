There is a silly youtube channel that I came across yesterday called "Prince Vegeta Motivation". 

It instantly recognized how persuasive this channel could be. 

It's a channel that uses an AI voice generator to create motivational videos of Prince Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.

Here's an example of one of the videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoTBGZskbbk

This channel has the potential to be a greater influence on gen z and millennial men than Andrew Tate. 

Robert Cialdini's (author of "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion") work on persuasion explains why this AI-voiced Vegeta will work. 

Cialdini identified six key principles of influence, three applying strongly here.

Authority: Vegeta's status as an unrelenting badass lends weight to his words.

Liking: Vegeta is one of the most popular characters in Dragon Ball Z.

Social proof: As the channel and views grow, the weight of the messages will increase.

One piece not mentioned in Cialdini's work is the power of nostalgia, which this channel also uses. 

The fusion of Dragon Ball Z, AI, and useful information creates a uniquely compelling content format.

It demonstrates how Cialdini's principles adapt to modern digital content strategies.

The channel's success could lead a whole generation to a better life.
