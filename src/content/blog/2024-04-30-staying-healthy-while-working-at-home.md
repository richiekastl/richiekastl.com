Prioritize your health, especially if you're working from home.

Working from home is a really good way to get heart disease. 

Sitting on your computer all day, inside, away from the sun. 

It's a recipe for diaster if you aren't careful. 

I use a treadmill desk whenever I have work to do that I can do on just two screens and is relatively creative (such as writing this very blog post).

I also use a timer at my desk to make sure I don't sit more than 2 hours at a time. 

Getting sunlight is also important, not only for your <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/find-an-article-o8Y0cfzNRUerXomxYWW3qQ" target="_blank">Circadian Rhythm</a>, but also for your heart health. 

Being in the sun helps prevent heart disease, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26766556/" target="_blank">aside from Vitamin D</a>. 

Also lifting will help prevent heart disease and help fight off the other <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/find-an-article-o8Y0cfzNRUerXomxYWW3qQ" target="_blank">3 horseman of death</a>, but it is pretty hard to make it out the gym and gym equipment takes up alot of space. 

I use the <a href="https://www.jaquishbiomedical.com/products/x3-bar/" target="_blank">X3 system to build muscle</a>. 

It takes up very little space and I get a great workout whenever I can fit it in.
