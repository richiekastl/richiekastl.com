In the race for attention, the front row is everything. 

Getting there fast is like grabbing the best seat at a huge concert right before the band appears. 

We launched a new site and scored first-page status on Google in three days for one of their keywords. 

The trick is that we focused on the right thing, low volume, high intent keywords. 

People assume it takes months to climb. 

Go for the low hanging fruit first. 

That's how you jump the line. 

Sometimes the best path isn’t the biggest stage. 

It’s the right stage.

Focus where it counts, and you’ll find yourself at the front faster than you ever thought possible.

Because in every race for attention, the best seat goes to those who know exactly where to look.
