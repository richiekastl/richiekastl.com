Do you want to live longer? Eat more protein. 

Doctor Peter Attia recommends eating 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. 

For me, that's about 200 grams of protein per day. 

This was hard for me to do at first, but eventually I figured it out. 

To achieve this, I do the following:

1. I have a glass of milk and I use a frother to mix in protein powder, creatine, and Athletic Greens.
2. I scoop out 2 plain greek yogurt cups into a bowl and I mix in a scoop of protein powder into that.
3. Every Sunday my wife and I meal prep containers that have 1 cup of ground chicken, 1 cup of rice, and some green peppers and onions. 

This ends up being around 2100 calories and 193 grams of protein.
