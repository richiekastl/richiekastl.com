description: My YouTube Channel's growth is so good...

YouTube is a long game, and I'm in it for at least the next 5 years.

I've only been in for about 2 months now and I have about 13 subscribers.

It is pretty discouraging but I'm going to keep putting out new videos every week and stay consistent with it.

It isn't about the amount of subscribers I have but whether or not I stay consistent with it..
