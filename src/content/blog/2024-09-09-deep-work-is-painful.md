Deep work is romanticized as a person sitting in a log cabin in the mountains working on their book using a typewriter. 

You can smell the coffee and the hearth. 

The keyboard clacks as each word effortlessly flows from their mind to the page. 

Hours pass and they don't notice. 

Nothing distracts them from their work. 

But deep work isn't always like this. 

Deep work is painful. 

Much like a body builder at the gym lifting weights is in pain, but they know with every rep that they are getting stronger. 

Deep work is the same. 

It hurts. 

You don't want to do it. 

But you need to do it. 

And with every rep you get a little stronger.
