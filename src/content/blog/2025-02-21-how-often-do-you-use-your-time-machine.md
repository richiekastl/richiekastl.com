Did you know that you have a time machine?

It is hidden in tiny moments.

A small hand in yours, a whispered stay.

Blink and you are decades ahead, longing for the now you once rushed through.

That is real time travel.

Gratitude lifts you out of the everyday grind and drops you back into what really counts.

The dishes will wait.

The emails will still be there when you return.

When you slow down just for a moment, you warp reality.

Your 90 year old self is cheering you on, begging for a taste of this present.

So be present.

Because it is not just about bedtime routines.

It is about catching the moments we usually let slip by.

Cherishing today is not a luxury.

It is a superpower.

And the future rewards those who remember to live fully while it is still called now.
