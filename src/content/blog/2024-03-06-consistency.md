Scott Adams coined the term "systems over goals". 

Having a system of good habits leads to better results than just setting big goals because systems make you do the right things every day without needing lots of willpower.

If you're trying to lose weight, have a diet system that you follow instead of having a lofty goal. 

Every day you don't reach your goal, you will feel like a failure.
