AI is so useful for monotonous tasks. 

I have a task I'm working on for a client where I need to take a bunch of products that are in a HTML file and turn them into markdown files. 

Doing this one by one would take hours of work. 

But with AI, it takes much less time. 

I can upload the HTML to Claude and ask it to extract the products. 

Then I can ask it to format the products into markdown.
