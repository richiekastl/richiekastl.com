description: Do you really think you can compete against entire industries funded to the tune of billions of dollars?

Expanding on my post from yesterday, I wanted to talk more about how to be productive while at home, specifically how to prevent distractions.

Home is where you relax and unwind, but since the pandemic, working at home has become normalized. 

How can you work while nobody is watching you? 

A couple tools I use are Cold Turkey and the Kitchen Safe. 

I can setup blocks of time on my calendar that I want to work, and Cold Turkey will prevent me from opening any social media or video games on my PC. 

The Kitchen Safe prevents me from scrolling on my phone. 

But how could people reach me if they need me you might be wondering. 

I have an Apple Watch. 

If there's an emergency (and there have been since I started using this system), I smash my Kitchen Safe box, grab my phone, and head out. 

You might also be thinking why don't you use your willpower?

Why do you need these tools to work? 

Are you a bitch or something? 

Well let me paint you a picture. 

How many people do you know who are addicted to video games? To social media? To "other things" you can find on the internet? 

I'd be willing to bet that most people in your life are addicted to one of these things. 

There are billions of dollars that go into these industries every year to optimize how to capture your attention. 

They don't care that you have your own dreams and work you want to pursue.

All they care about is that you get to the next level on Candy Crush. 

You are cattle to them. 

They just want you to suck down the slop they feed you. 

Fatten you up, consume their products, then instead of getting slaughtered you get diabetes, cancer, heart disease, or a neurodegenerative disease such as alzheimer's or dementia (Dr. Peter Attia's four horsemen of death). 

Then you become the cattle of a different industry, big pharma, that will gladly help you treat the deadly disease that you've contracted.

How can video games or social media cause one of the four horsemen diseases?

Well because you were distracted, you didn't go to the gym. 

Because you were distracted, you sat inside all day and didn't get any sunlight. 

Because you were distracted, you didn't meal prep and you ordered fast food. 

Because you were distracted, you didn't get as much work done as you needed to, so you get drunk again that night to help numb the pain. 

Because you were distracted, your much more stressed at work, wondering if they will fire you any day now, so you start smoking again. 

Because you were distracted, you didn't work towards your dream, and this is just another day lost that you will never back. 

Because you were distracted, you will die unfulfilled, just cattle.
