The one thing we can all learn from the Hannah Barron situation is to lean into your own strengths. 

If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's the original tweet. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This accent needs to be illegal and women should be banned from doing manual labour like this.<br><br>There is NOTHING feminine about American women.<br><br>American women are literally men. <a href="https://t.co/iypi1CGNov">pic.twitter.com/iypi1CGNov</a></p>&mdash; Samirah (@SameeraKhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/SameeraKhan/status/1766262871971835967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This blew up to 60 million views as of the time of this post. 

Then this is her response:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This young lady just BODIED everyone that was giving her grief. And she did it by being bout the sweetest young thing you ever did see. Kudos young lady. <a href="https://t.co/PAaOb2ihmo">pic.twitter.com/PAaOb2ihmo</a></p>&mdash; Phil Labonte, Talent Terrorist (@philthatremains) <a href="https://twitter.com/philthatremains/status/1767001141903229088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Her response video to the bullies calling her out was A+.
