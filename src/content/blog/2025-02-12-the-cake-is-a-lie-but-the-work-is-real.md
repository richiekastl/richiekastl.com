description: The Cake is a Lie (But the Work is Real)

Every great project starts with a ridiculous idea.

A rogue-like autobattler where you fight for the entertainment of a cosmic being made out of Cake? Silly. Absurd. Unreasonable.

And yet, here I am, breaking it down into code, systems, mechanics, AI decision trees, and a hundred tiny tasks that—if we’re lucky—come together to form something people want to play.

Because the idea is never the hard part. The work is.

The work is taking a massive, vague, ambitious thing and slicing it into bite-sized, doable chunks.
The work is giving an AI a structured prompt instead of an open-ended wish.
The work is waking up, opening your laptop, and solving just one problem today.

And when you get the process right—when you embrace the grind, when you trust the framework—you realize something:

The cake doesn’t matter. The system that gets you there does.

That’s the secret to building anything: You don’t chase the cake. You build the bakery.

And then, one day, you look up and see a game, a business, a dream—fully baked, sitting right in front of you.
