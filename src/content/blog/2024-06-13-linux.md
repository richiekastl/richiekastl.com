I just installed Ubuntu on an old laptop that I had lying around and it is fantastic. 

I tried using this laptop before for work but it was really slow, Ubuntu breathed new life into it. 

Ubuntu saved me from buying a new $1k laptop. 

I haven't used Ubuntu since I was in college and it does everything I need it to do. 

It is super easy to setup, it feels like a normal operating system, and installing apps using the command line is really fast. 

I suggest taking a look into it.
