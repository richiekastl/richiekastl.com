Keeping a clean environment helps your productivity. 

Every time you walk around and see a mess, it'll pollute your brain space. 

This is true in digital form too. 

To help combat this I have a .bat file that runs everytime I start up my computer. 

One of the things it does is that it deletes a folder I have on my desktop and remakes it. 

It's called "temp".

Throughout my day as a web developer/designer, clients send me assets to add to their sites. 

Instead of keeping everything in one huge downloads folder, I save those assets to "temp", and upload them to the site. 

Then I don't have to think about removing those files I'll never use again from my computer, they'll just be gone next time I boot up.
