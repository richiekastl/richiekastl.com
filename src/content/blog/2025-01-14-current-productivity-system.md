I've used dozens of productivity systems over the years. 

The one I'm currently using has been working well for me. 

I write down everything I want to do in a quarter on a list in Notion. 

I pin that to my favorites and I can see it all the time. 

Then I have a page that is simply called "To do". 

Each week, I create a new page in my "To do" page that has everything I need to get done that week according to my quarterly list. 

I also update this page throughout the week as clients have new requests. 

Whenever I'm in "working time", I just look at my list of things to do that week and do them. 

Simple.
