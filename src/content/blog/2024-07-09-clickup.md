I've been experimenting with Clickup for a while now and I'm pretty happy with it. 

One of my agency clients turned me onto it. 

I use it to keep track of every task that I need to do in a day, from business to personal. 

I really like it because of the recurring tasks, it makes it easy to keep track of all of the routine tasks that I need to get done each day.

An example of this is that I like to look at an exit report for each of my clients at the end of the month. 

That's where I identify the pages that most people leave their site on, those are usually pages that need to be updated. 

I don't have to remember to do it, the task will just appear on my dashboard that day. 

Overall I'd recommend it.
