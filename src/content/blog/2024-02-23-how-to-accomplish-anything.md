How could you accomplish a big goal that you have? The thing that seems impossible right now. 

I've accomplished quite a few huge goals in my life, such as running 6 marathons, singing to my wife at my wedding in front of all of our family and friends, and starting my own web design agency. 

The "secret" to doing all of these things is to put it on your calendar and dedicate time to it every single day. 

For singing to my wife, I blocked out at least a half hour everyday to practice singing. I would either practice notes or I would run through the song I picked. 

For marathon training I set up a training plan, I put it on my calendar, and if I have to run that day I run. 

For starting my own web design company, while I was working a job I consumed many, many business books and watched YouTube videos of people who did the same. I also took action and I was working freelance on the side while also working my full-time job. 

What do you want to accomplish? 

Do you want to become a dentist? Google "how to become a dentist", find out what you need to do, then dedicate time to it everday. Eventually you'll be a dentist.
