description: Why my Tiny Habits idea was successful.
---

So far this Tiny Habits idea of just having my editor open as soon as I turn on my computer has been successful. I completely forgot that I was supposed to write a blog post this morning and then boop, my editor comes up. I recommend you find how a Tiny Habit could help you out.
