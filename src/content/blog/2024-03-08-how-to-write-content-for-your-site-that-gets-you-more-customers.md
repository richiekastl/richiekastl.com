I'm going through <a href="https://wesmcdowell.com/profitable-website-launchpad/">Wes Mcdowell's Profitable Website Launchpad</a> course and I highly recommend it. 

Yesterday, I wrote up content for a new website I'm launching soon. 

It's the best content I've ever written. 

Below are the notes I took from that course summarized by Claude AI. 

1.  Identify your client's main problem and the symptoms/emotions associated with it. Focus your website copy on addressing this core problem.
2.  Position yourself as the mentor/guide who understands the client's problem and has the authority and experience to solve it. Use testimonials, stats, and logos to build credibility.
3.  Have a clear call-to-action telling prospects exactly what step to take next. Make it specific and benefits-focused, not generic like "Contact Us."
4.  Outline a simple 3-step plan showing prospects the path from where they are now to achieving the results they want. Give your process a memorable name.
5.  Focus copy on benefits (what your service does for the client) more than just features. Tie benefits to emotions.
6.  Overcome common objections upfront on your website, like price, time commitment, skepticism, and trust.
7.  Motivate action by raising the stakes - highlight what prospects stand to lose by not using your service.
8.  For the home page, follow a proven layout: Hero section, problem, solution, benefits, process, testimonials, features, and a "wild card" section.
9.  Build dedicated pages for your core services, about page, pricing, FAQs, and success stories. Keep the focus on the customer.
10. Use a lead magnet that promises a desirable outcome to capture email addresses and generate leads.
