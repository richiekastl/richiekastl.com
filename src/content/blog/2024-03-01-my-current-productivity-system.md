description: Revealing my productivity stack
---

I have a productivity stack that I haven't seen anyone else use. 

I use <a href="https://clickup.com/" target="_blank">Clickup.com</a> to manage everything that I have to do that day. 

I have several recurring tasks, such as checking the position of a certain set of keywords and for working out. 

I always know what I need to do that day. 

That's not the entire battle though. 

The entire battle is that I'm only accountable to myself, I don't really have a boss (unless you count my clients as "bosses"). 

To really maximize my time, I have a stack of products I use to get my day to day work done. 

First is <a href="https://2000books.com/focusblocks/" target="_blank">focus blocks</a>. 

Whenever you log into focus blocks, you get placed on a call with many other people from across the world who also want to focus on the job that they're doing. 

Then I also use <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/" target="_blank">Cold Turkey</a>. 

Cold Turkey shuts down any sort of video game, social media, or news site on my computer for the time I specify and it is very hard to shut it down. 

The last thing I use to inject productivity into my veins is <a href="https://www.focusatwill.com/" target="_blank">focus@will</a>.

Focus@will uses binaural beats that hack your brain into a productivity mode. 

I don't want to pretend I understand all the science behind it but it works for me. 

This is my productivity stack simplified:
- I know what I'm going to do that day the night before
- Focus Blocks + Cold Turkey + Focus@will
