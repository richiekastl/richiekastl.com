I've already fallen out of the habit of blogging everyday.

Last summer, I read a book called Tiny Habits. I'll give you the 80% of the useful lessons in the book here.

In the book, the author suggests the following to form a new habit:

1. Identify a habit that you already have that will make sense to incorporate your new habit with, for example, flossing after brushing your teeth.
2. Do the smallest thing possible with your new habit, for the flossing example, floss only one tooth and then throw out the floss.
3. Do this for about 2 weeks and if you want to floss all of your teeth go ahead, but at least try to get one tooth flossed.
4. Overtime this will build the habit.

I used the framework above to get into the habit of flossing my teeth, I've never flossed my teeth so consistently in my life.

I'm going to use the same framework for blogging everyday. This is my plan:

1. Have VS Code startup when I turn on my computer.
2. Create a new post and write at least one sentence.
3. Publish it

There might be some future blog posts that are only a sentence long, and this is why.
