Have you ever caught yourself scrolling through social media, completely unaware of how much time has passed? 

You're not alone. 

As a programmer with 15 years of experience and a studying hypnotist, I've found a startling connection between technology and hypnosis that might just change how you view your favorite apps.

Imagine picking up your phone for a "quick check" of Instagram or TikTok. 

Before you know it, an hour has vanished. 

How does this happen? 

You've just experienced a trance state more powerful than most professional hypnotists can induce.

While you're mindlessly swiping and tapping, something is happening beneath the surface. 

Your beliefs are being subtly reshaped by the content you consume. 

It's a process so smooth, you won't even notice it happening.

You might think, "But I'm in control! I'm teaching the algorithm what I like." 

And you're mostly right. 

You'll still get served content outside of what you like though. 

These videos will entertain you, others will educate you. 

You think that the app is useful, so you'll keep using it. 

This is where the real danger lies. 

As your beliefs slowly shift over time, you'll attribute these changes to your own volition. 

After all, you're the one choosing what to watch, right? 

Right?
